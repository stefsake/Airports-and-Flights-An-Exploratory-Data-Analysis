# Airports & Flights: An Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset used in this project contains more than 1,000,000 commercial US airline flights records from 2015.
Each record represents a single flight, including:
airline name,
flight number,
origin/destination airport, 
flight distance,
scheduled/actual departure, as well as 
arrival times. 
The aim of the project was to analyze the dataset and summarize the main characteristics with an interactive data visualization report. The data was first imported into SQL Server from a .csv file, and then connected to Microsoft Power BI for analysis and visualization. A  pdf report highlighting the key insights as well as a Power BI file (.pbix) with an interactive dashboard are provided. Moreover, a .sql file containing queries for analyzing the data is included.
To open the Power BI file, Power BI Desktop must be installed.
